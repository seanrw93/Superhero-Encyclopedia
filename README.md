# Superhero Encyclopedia

A responsive web page that uses Vanilla JS to functions to fetch data from the Superhero API using a token and a base URL, then display a random or searched superhero's image on a web page based on user input.

The project could be expanded upon by fetching specific stats about each superhero and incorporating it into the UI.
